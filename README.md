   <h5><b>Everything Data!</b></h5>
   <p>As a group, we learned what are <i>plots</i>, when to utilize them in as scenario, and how to graph them with datasets. My group was required to visually graph all six plots within <b>Tableau, Python code, and Jupyter Lab.</b></p>

   <h4><b>Weather Trends--Specifically Tornadoes</b></h4>
   <p>In this course, Dr. Miller, assigned the class with individual research to complete. Students chose a topic to research, ensured there was a mass dataset (mine was over 86,000 rows of information), Wrangle data, and perform data analysis based on the information. The end project was presented in front of a small student class.</p>

    <p>Here with <b>Telnet</b>, there were attempts made to contact the Bowie State Server. Fortunately, for the University and their ELITE Computer Science and Technology students/staff, students were unable to access the ports.</p><p><a href="https://studentsbowiestate-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/wigginsa0909_students_bowiestate_edu/IQAXqyZNoYIPTZkRwDbWUJBXAUI_gbNZkppr-gAshmK3eCY?e=lcxTZy">Telnet Simulation</a></p>
